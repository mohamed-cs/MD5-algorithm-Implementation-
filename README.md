# MD5 algorithm Implementation 

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. MD5 can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption.
